**Task 1: Number guessing game**

This "number guessing game" project in Java is a game that allows the user to play.
The player have to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range (between 1 to 100).
This program prompts the user to input their guess, compares it to the generated number, and provides feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low. They have a maximum of 5 attempts to guess the correct number, and for each attempt, they receive a score of either 0 or 1 depending on whether their guess is correct or not. The game also allows players to play again if they wish to continue after the current game is over.

**How to Play**
Clone the repository to your local machine. 
Compile and run the 'NumberGame.java' file to start the game.
Enter your guessed number between 1 to 100. 
You have a maximum of 5 attempts to guess the correct number. 
After each attempt, you will be informed if your guess is correct, too high, or too low. 
If you guess the correct number, you win the game! If you exhaust all your attempts, the game ends with a "GAME OVER" message, revealing the correct number. After each game, you can choose to play again or exit the game.

Enjoy the Number Guessing Game, and have fun testing your guessing skills!
